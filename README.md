# zoomClone

This project involved setting up a Zoom-like application using the VidStream library and Tkinter for GUI. 

I learned how to establish a streaming server and an audio receiver, allowing communication between devices. 

I utilized threading to manage concurrent tasks, such as starting the server and streaming camera, screen, and audio inputs. 

The GUI was created using Tkinter, featuring buttons to initiate various streaming functionalities.



There are some issues in screen sharing that I'll fix soon hopefully.
